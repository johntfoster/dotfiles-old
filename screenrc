##    Explanation of hardstatus line    ##

# Note the embeded space after the colon, I feel
#  it just looks nicer with a blank between the
#  text and console edge:
#   '%{=b}%{G} Screens: '

# This prints the window listing in blue:
#   '%{b}%w'

# This right-aligns what follows:
#   '%='

# This displays the time (hours and minutes) in 12hr format
# and adds an AM/PM flag, in bold green:
#   '%{G}%C%A'

# This displays the day of the week:
#   '%D'

#This displays the date in Mon/day/year format:
# and again I embeded a space to give me one space
# between the text and console edge:
#  '%M/%d/%Y '

# The resultsing command give you a status line that
#  looks like this:
#   | Screens: 0* bash  <blanks zapped>         5:30PM  Fri, Jun/25/2004 |
#  (The pipes indicate the edges of the xterm/console).

# Green text, time, and date; windows in blue:
hardstatus alwayslastline "%{=b}%{G} Screen(s): %{b}%w %=%{kG}%C%A  %D, %M/%d/%Y "

# Turn off start message:
startup_message off

# Set messages timeout to one second:
msgwait 1

# Start a bash shell

# Increase the scrollback buffer
